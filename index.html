            <h2>Short Essay on SDLC Stages</h2>
            <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development that ensures quality, efficiency, and organization throughout the creation process. Each stage in the SDLC serves a unique purpose and involves specific activities. Below is a brief explanation of each stage:</p>

            <h3>1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The goal of this phase is to understand what the client or end-user wants the software to achieve.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meetings with stakeholders to gather functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
                <li>Documenting the requirements in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS).</li>
                <li>Analyzing the feasibility of the project based on resources, budget, and technology.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. System Design</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Translate the requirements into a blueprint for how the system will work and be constructed.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Designing the architecture of the software, including data flow and interactions between components.</li>
                <li>Creation of design documents like Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and System Architecture.</li>
                <li>Selecting the appropriate technologies, tools, and frameworks needed for implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Implementation (Coding)</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> In this phase, the actual code for the software is written according to the design specifications.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developers work on writing the code using the chosen programming languages and tools.</li>
                <li>Breaking down tasks into smaller modules for easier development.</li>
                <li>Version control and regular code reviews to ensure quality and adherence to standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Testing</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensure that the software works as intended and meets the requirements set in the first stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting various types of testing such as Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).</li>
                <li>Identifying and fixing bugs or errors.</li>
                <li>Validating whether the software functions in real-world scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Deployment</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The software is made available to the users, either in a live production environment or a staging environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Packaging the software for release.</li>
                <li>Configuring the server or platform where the software will run.</li>
                <li>Training users and providing documentation or support resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>6. Maintenance</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> After deployment, the software may require updates, patches, or bug fixes over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Activities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Addressing user-reported issues and resolving any post-deployment bugs.</li>
                <li>Releasing patches or updates to improve performance or add new features.</li>
                <li>Monitoring the system for future enhancements or upgrades.</li>
            </ul>
